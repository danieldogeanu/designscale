# Design Scale

A design scale cheat sheet to be used for spacing or size values in a project.

## Motivation

Whether you use a 4pt scale or a 8pt scale for your design project, it usually requires manual calculations, which can be time-consuming and tedious. I wanted a quick and easy way to access the correct values at a glance and experiment with the design more easily. Therefore, I initially created a cheat sheet of the numbers in the form of an image, but it could only fit so many numbers, and it couldn't be searched at all. To overcome these limitations, I developed this app, which allows users to search for and verify the numbers on the chosen scale. I hope this is useful to you.

## Commands

- `yarn install` - Installs the project's dependencies.
- `yarn dev` - Runs the development environment and starts a server on port `5173`. You can pass the `--host` argument, to expose the development server to the local network, so you can preview the web app on other devices.
- `yarn lint` - Runs ESLint, to scan the code for problems.
- `yarn build` - Builds and bundles the project for production.
- `yarn preview` - Runs a server for previewing the production build on port `4173`. You can pass the `--host` argument here as well, to expose  the server to the local network.
