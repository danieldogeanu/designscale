# Design Scale

A design scale cheat sheet to be used for spacing or size values in a project.

## Motivation

Whether you use a 4pt scale or a 8pt scale for your design project, it usually requires manual calculations, which can be time-consuming and tedious. I wanted a quick and easy way to access the correct values at a glance and experiment with the design more easily. Therefore, I initially created a cheat sheet of the numbers in the form of an image, but it could only fit so many numbers, and it couldn't be searched at all. To overcome these limitations, I developed this app, which allows users to search for and verify the numbers on the chosen scale.

I hope this is useful to you. If it is, you can [buy me a coffee here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/danieldogeanu).
